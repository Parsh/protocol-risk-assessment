# Requirements: UC2 - Financial Risk Assessment of DeFi Protocol Integrations

## Objective
Mitigate financial loss and reputational damage by proactively evaluating the risk of integrating with or listing tokens from decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Risk is evaluated based on:
- Technical security posture
- Governance structure
- Liquidity robustness
- Developer trustworthiness

---

## Actors
- **Primary Actor**: Exchange Risk & Security Operations Team / Protocol Listing Committee
- **Other Stakeholders**:
  - Chief Risk Officer (CRO)
  - Treasury and Product Strategy Teams
  - Security Engineering Team

---

## Preconditions
- Protocol/token under consideration for integration or listing
- Access to:
  - Smart contract code repositories (e.g., GitHub, Etherscan)
  - Blockchain data and financial metrics (e.g., DeFiLlama, CoinGecko)
  - Developer metadata
- Internal risk scoring criteria is available

---

## Triggers
- Submission of a DeFi protocol/token for listing
- Business proposal for partnership or integration

---

## Main Success Scenario
1. Ingest protocol data (contract addresses, token metadata, governance docs)
2. Perform static and dynamic analysis of smart contracts for vulnerabilities
3. Analyze governance token distribution for centralization/hostile control
4. Assess TVL, liquidity metrics, volatility, and slippage risks
5. Conduct OSINT and attribution analysis on developers/founders
6. Generate a multi-dimensional risk score across:
   - Technical
   - Governance
   - Liquidity
   - Reputational dimensions
7. If risk score exceeds threshold:
   - Flag the protocol
   - Quarantine or reject listing/integration
   - Log the decision for audit purposes

---

## Alternative Paths
- If contract source code or dev IDs are unverifiable, assign elevated uncertainty weighting
- If liquidity data is unavailable, fallback to historical volatility proxies

---

## Postconditions
- High-risk protocols are excluded from exchange/platform
- All decisions are auditable and justified
- Risk exposure to protocol-level exploits is minimized

---

## Functional Requirements

- **Smart Contract Analyzer**
  - Perform static analysis (e.g., reentrancy, access control)
  - Dynamic simulation testing
  - Use verified contracts from Etherscan, BscScan, etc.

- **Governance Evaluator**
  - Analyze token distribution

- **Liquidity & TVL Monitor**
  - Integrate APIs from DeFiLlama, CoinGecko, DeFiPulse
  - Monitor slippage, volatility, asset concentration

- **Developer Reputation Scanner**
  - Correlate GitHub/GitLab identities
  - Run OSINT for malicious affiliations or exploits history

- **Risk Scoring Engine**
  - Aggregate all metrics into a composite score
  - Apply configurable thresholds per risk category

- **Audit & Logging System**
  - Capture inputs, assessments, and decisions
  - Store for regulatory review or internal audit

---

## User Stories

- As a Protocol Listing Committee member, I want to assess DeFi protocol risks so I can make informed listing decisions.
- As a Security Engineer, I want automated vulnerability scanning of smart contracts to detect risks before integration.
- As a Treasury Manager, I want to evaluate governance and liquidity to reduce exposure to unstable or malicious protocols.

---

## Key Data Sources

- **Code Repositories**: GitHub, GitLab, Etherscan, BscScan, Polygonscan
- **Financial Metrics**: DeFiLlama, DeFiPulse, CoinGecko APIs
- **Governance Platforms**: Snapshot
- **Developer Metadata**: GitHub OSINT, Audit Reports

---

## Potential Tools & APIs 
- Static Analysis: Slither, MythX, Echidna
- Liquidity Analytics: DeFiLlama, CoinGecko
- Governance Data: Snapshot API

---

## Risk Score Dimensions (Sample Weights)
- Technical Vulnerabilities: 40%
- Governance Centralization Risk: 25%
- Liquidity/TVL Risk: 20%
- Developer Trust/Reputation: 15%

Additionally, we can use AI to implement an AI based risk scoring mechanism.

---

## Output
- `risk_score.json` or database entry with risk category breakdown
- Audit log of risk decision with protocol metadata
- Dashboard or report for listing committee
