# DeFi Protocol Risk Assessment Microservice

A Node.js/TypeScript microservice for comprehensive risk assessment of DeFi protocols, focusing on smart contract analysis, governance evaluation, liquidity metrics, and developer reputation.

## 🚀 Current Status: Phase 1.1 Complete ✅

### ✅ Completed Features
- **Project Bootstrap**: Full TypeScript setup with strict mode
- **Development Environment**: Nodemon, ESLint, Prettier configured
- **Project Structure**: Complete directory organization
- **Environment Configuration**: Dev/prod environment configs
- **Build System**: TypeScript compilation and npm scripts
- **Git Repository**: Initialized with proper .gitignore

### 🔄 Next Phase: 1.2 - Basic API Framework
- Express server setup with TypeScript
- Security middleware (Helmet, CORS)
- Request logging with Winston
- Input validation middleware
- Error handling middleware
- Health check endpoint

## 🛠️ Development Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start development server with hot reload
npm run build        # Build TypeScript to JavaScript
npm run start        # Run production build
npm run type-check   # Check TypeScript types

# Code Quality
npm run format       # Format code with Prettier
# Note: ESLint temporarily disabled due to Node version compatibility
```

## 🔧 Environment Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Configure environment variables (API keys optional for initial phases)
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. Run `npm run dev` to start development server

## 📊 Implementation Phases

- ✅ **Phase 1.1**: Project Bootstrap (Complete)
- 🔄 **Phase 1.2**: Basic API Framework (Next)
- 📋 **Phase 1.3**: File Storage Foundation
- 📋 **Phase 2**: Core Data & Protocol Management
- 📋 **Phase 3**: Assessment Framework
- 📋 **Phase 4**: External Data Integration
- 📋 **Phase 5**: Slither Smart Contract Analysis
- 📋 **Phase 6**: Multi-Dimensional Risk Analyzers
- 📋 **Phase 7**: Integration & Testing
- 📋 **Phase 8**: Production Deployment

## 🎯 Project Goals

- **Academic Focus**: Designed for Master's thesis project
- **DeFi Security**: Deep smart contract vulnerability analysis using Slither
- **Multi-Dimensional Risk**: Technical, governance, liquidity, and reputation scoring
- **Production Ready**: Containerized microservice architecture
- **File-Based Storage**: Simplified data persistence for academic environments
