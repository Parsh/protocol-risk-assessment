# DeFi Protocol Risk Assessment Microservice

A Node.js/TypeScript microservice for comprehensive risk assessment of DeFi protocols, featuring multi-dimensional analysis including smart contract security, governance evaluation, liquidity metrics, and developer reputation.

## 🚀 Current Status: Phase 6 Complete ✅

### ✅ Completed Features
- **🏗️ Core Infrastructure**: Full TypeScript setup with strict mode, Express API framework
- **🔒 Security & Middleware**: Helmet, CORS, rate limiting, input validation, comprehensive error handling
- **📊 Data Management**: File-based storage with atomic operations, backup systems, caching
- **🧠 Risk Assessment Engine**: Multi-dimensional scoring with weighted categories and confidence metrics
- **🔍 Smart Contract Analysis**: Slither integration for vulnerability detection and technical risk assessment
- **🏛️ Governance Analysis**: Token concentration, voting mechanisms, multi-sig evaluation with mock data fallbacks
- **💧 Liquidity Analysis**: TVL assessment, volume analysis, depth metrics, slippage calculations
- **👥 Reputation Analysis**: Team evaluation, development activity, code quality, audit history
- **🎯 Assessment Orchestrator**: Coordinated execution of all analyzers with proper error handling
- **📡 Blockchain Integration**: Multi-chain support (Ethereum, BSC, Polygon) with API fallbacks
- **� DeFi Data Integration**: DeFiLlama and CoinGecko APIs with intelligent caching
- **🛡️ Demo Safety**: Complete mock data fallbacks - no API keys required for basic functionality

### 🎯 Multi-Dimensional Risk Analysis
The system now provides comprehensive risk assessment across four key dimensions:

1. **Technical Analysis (40% weight)**: Smart contract vulnerabilities, code quality, security practices
2. **Liquidity Analysis (20% weight)**: TVL stability, trading volume, market depth, slippage risks  
3. **Governance Analysis (25% weight)**: Decentralization, voting mechanisms, proposal activity
4. **Reputation Analysis (15% weight)**: Team experience, development activity, audit history

### 🔧 Key Capabilities
- **Real-time Assessment**: Complete protocol evaluation in under 90 seconds
- **Intelligent Scoring**: 0-100 risk scores with confidence metrics and risk level classification
- **Comprehensive Findings**: Detailed vulnerability reports and risk factor analysis
- **API-First Design**: RESTful endpoints for protocol management and assessment execution
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive logging, error handling, and monitoring capabilities
